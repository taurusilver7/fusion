# Fusion

A responsive soccer stats, teams info application powered by Next.JS 13, Typescript, Tailwindcss.

The Application uses API-Football to request stats required to populate the application.

## Available Scripts

First, create a starter template and run the development server:

```bash
npm create-next-app@latest <name> --typescript --tailwind --eslint
# and
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

## Build

Refactor the starter template to suit `Fusion`. Add the main background in the layout for the application.

Modify the main layout to fit `Seachbar` into the body, parallel to children components.

Create Searchbar & SearchbarForm components for extensive search results.

Create a RapidApi to get access to the Authorized API key to link with the application. Create multiple types for API response based on the reference in the website.

To process the response, create a utility function `getStandings`. CUstomize the request options with a revalidate period of 24 hours.

The nextjs revalidates the fetched data at specific intervals. The server will cache the data for 24 hours & feed the application with cached data when many requests are made. This prevents the unnecessary usage of API calls.

However, the `npm run dev` command for development server will not cache the data, consuming API calls for every hot-reload/refresh. It is suggested to use a sample data while development.

Create a `getTeams` utility function to get teams response

Create a searchBar component to house the logo & the searchBarForm. Create the helper functions & events for the search input.

Create a StandingsAndFixtures component to list out the match results between teams for different leagues.

Create a FixtureInfo type to populate the fixture details on the mainpage. Get the fixtures params from the API-football response-samples.

Create LeagueFixtures, Teams, Goals type to populate Fixtures into the main page. Create a util function to get Fixtures from the API endpoint.

From getFixtures, filter the fixtures for five leagues in a new util function.

Populate the filtered fixtures in StandingsAndFixtures through Home page. The util function is a server-only function, and can only be incorporated into client component through a server page.

Populate the Standings & Fixtures in the main page. Each standing & fixture lead to either a team or a match. Create team page with [id] param to populate the team filtered through fixtures.

Create a util function to get team info from Team & fixtures information from team Id, using the team id params.
